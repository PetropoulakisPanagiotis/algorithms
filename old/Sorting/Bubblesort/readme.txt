Bubble sort algorithm.

It uses comparisons to operate on elements. As a result it is a comparison sort. Although the algorithm is simple, most of the other sorting algorithms are more efficient for large data.
Bubble sort is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

Performance: Worst case and average complexity O(n^2)

Comments:
The only advantage that bubble sort has is the ability to detect that the array is sorted efficiently is built into the algorithm. When the list is already sorted (best-case), the complexity of bubble sort is only O(n).
